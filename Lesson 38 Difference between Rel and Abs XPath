dictionary meaning: 
Absolute XPath :- It starts with the root node or a forward slash (/). The advantage of using absolute is, it identifies the element very fast. ... Relative Xpath :- A relative xpath is 
one where the path starts from the node of your choice 
		– it doesn't need to start from the root node.
